# Cross Platform Rendering Engine

## TODOs

- [IN PROGRESS] Pixel Rendering Engine
- [ ] Physically Based Rendering Engine

## What I was doing last time

The Scene is facing issues to load data from pixel_rendering header, need to
keep looking into that. Once this is done a small refactoring wouldn't be that
bad, before start the development of the physically based part.

There is some configs splited over the code, need to add a common place for 
those.
