### Project Motivation

The project have two main motivations. 

First I've been studying about Computer Graphics and Graphics Programming 
for a while, and I'd like a challenge, a software where I can constantly add
new features, improve the existing ones, implement scientific papers and so on, 
instead of many individual and small programs. 

The second motivation is that I pretend to use this project as my final
assignment on university to achieve my Computer Scientist degree.
