# Cross Platform Rendering Engine

A Cross Platform Rendering Engine that works on Windows and Unix systems with 
Cross Graphic APIs.

- Windows
    - OpenGL
    - Vulkan

- Unix 
    - OpenGL
    - Vulkan

The "switch" between graphic APIs is done through different compile parameters,
with the user choosing which API it would like to use, being available on its
Operational System. Everything else is handled by the code and build process.
