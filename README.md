# Cross Platform Rendering Engine

A Cross Platform Rendering Engine that works on Windows and Unix systems with 
Cross Graphic APIs.

- Windows
    - OpenGL
    - Vulkan
    - DirectX

- Unix 
    - OpenGL
    - Vulkan

The "switch" between graphic APIs is done through different compile parameters,
with the user choosing which API it would like to use, being available on its
Operational System. Everything else is handled by the code and build process.

### Project Motivation

The project have two main motivations. 

First I've been studying about Computer Graphics and Graphics Programming for 
a while, and I'd like a challenge, a software where I can constantly add new 
features, improve the existing ones, implement scientific papers and so on, 
instead of many individual and small programs. 

The second motivation is that I pretend to use this project as my final
assignment on university to achieve my Computer Scientist degree.
